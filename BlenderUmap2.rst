This specific version of BlenderUmap is an unofficial fork, but don't let that scare you. BlenderUmap2 is much better than the original. 
This guide will go over how to install and optimal settings.

If you are using the Free Github version, you will need to build the addon yourself (we cover this).
For patrons, you can skip to here_ for installation.

I **HIGHLY RECCOMEND** to fully read this guide and not skip anything unless told explicitly so. This is for you, not to waste your time.

*Side Note for Github Users: The building process only documents how to do it on windows. A MacOS / Linux guide may come at a later date, but is not guarenteed.*

Requirements
============
Blender v3.y.z
--------------

Any version past Blender 3.0.0 will work. You can download blender `here <https://www.blender.org/download/>`_

Python 3
--------

Any version of Python 3 **SHOULD** work, however this is not confirmed. This will be used to build the addon for Github users.
You can download python `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_. 
  **MAKE SURE** to check ``Add python to PATH`` once installation is finished.

Some Technical Competence / Patience
------------------------------------

This is not a process for people not willing to learn and tinker with things. This guide wont hold your hand through everything. Errors and unexpected issues are bound to happen and thats not something I can control.
If you are experiencing issues; Don't give up or ask for help immediately. Instead, try to work out what went wrong and what you can do to fix it.

This process will also take time. If you don't have patience, then this isn't the hobby for you.

Now that all of that is out of the way, lets get into the build phase

----

Downloading / Building the addon (for Free Github Users)
========================================================
1.  Download the source code for BlenderUmap2 `here <https://github.com/MinshuG/BlenderUmap2/archive/refs/heads/better-materials.zip>`_
2.  Extract the .zip file however you desire and enter the folder.
3.  In the address bar at the top, click the blank space in it and type ``cmd``, and press enter.
4.  Type the following command into the new Command Prompt window:

>>> python make_release.py

Or if that doesn't work: 

>>> python3 make_release.py

5. Wait for this to finish. This **WILL** take a while
6. In the new ``Release`` folder, delete the ``MacOSX`` and ``Linux`` zip files, and just leave the windows one. This is the one we want.

And that is it! You have successfully built BlenderUmap2!
