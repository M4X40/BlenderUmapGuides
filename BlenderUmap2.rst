This specific version of BlenderUmap is an unofficial fork, but don't let that scare you. BlenderUmap2 is much better than the original. 
This guide will go over how to install and optimal settings.

If you are using the Free Github version, you will need to build the addon yourself (we cover this).
For patrons, you can skip to ___here___ for installation.

I **HIGHLY RECCOMEND** to fully read this guide and not skip anything unless told explicitly so. This is for you, not to waste your time.

  **MAKE SURE** to check ``Add python to PATH`` once installation is finished.

Some Technical Competence / Patience
------------------------------------

This is not a process for people not willing to learn and tinker with things. This guide wont hold your hand through everything. Errors and unexpected issues are bound to happen and thats not something I can control.
If you are experiencing issues; Don't give up or ask for help immediately. Instead, try to work out what went wrong and what you can do to fix it.

This process will also take time. If you don't have patience, then this isn't the hobby for you.
